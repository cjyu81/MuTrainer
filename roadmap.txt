This is a text file listing Charlie's personal roadmap for the Mu Trainer project

This project was started approximately April of 2020 but back then I was a junior
who had never coded in Python. It took me a long time to learn the basics of
Python and its wonderful machine learning libraries.

Roadmap:
Make it runnable
Make it interactable
Make it faster
